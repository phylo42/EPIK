v0.2.0

The pre-publication release intended to be the reference version for the further improvements. Previous releases are left mostly for history and are not supposed to be used.

- Supported partial loading of databases with phylo-k-mer filtering (--mu, --max-ram)
- Reintroduced parallelism (--threads)
- Reworked LWR formula so that it is normalized over all branches of the tree
- Various improvements and fixes
- Removed the old changelog since it was related to the functionality that had migrated to IPK
