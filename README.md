EPIK is a program for rapid alignment-free phylogenetic placement, the successor of [RAPPAS](https://github.com/phylo42/RAPPAS).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Boost Libraries >=1.6
- CMake >= 3.10
- GCC compiler must support c++17
- zlib
- rapidjson
- click

On Debian-like systems they can be installed with:
```
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libboost-dev libboost-serialization-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-iostreams-dev libboost-program-options-dev zlib1g-dev rapidjson-dev libquadmath0 python3-pip
pip3 install click
```

### Clone and build
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/phylo42/EPIK epik
cd epik && mkdir -p bin && cd bin
cmake ..
make -j4
```

### Install
You can use `epik.py` from the directory where it was built or install it system-wide or for a single user to make `epik.py` visible from any directory.

For a system-wide installation (requires elevated permissions):
```
sudo cmake --install .
```

Alternatively, to install for the current user, choose a directory where you want to install the tool. For instance, you might choose `/home/$USER/opt` or any other directory that you prefer. Replace `DIRECTORY` in the commands below with your chosen directory path:

```
cmake --install . --prefix DIRECTORY
export PATH=DIRECTORY/bin:$PATH
```
Remember to export the `DIRECTORY/bin` to your `PATH`. You can do this manually each time or add the export command to your shell initialization scripts (e.g., `.bashrc`).


## Usage


### Phylogenetic placement
To place queries to a phylogenetic tree, you need to first preprocess it with IPK and make a phylo-k-mer database (see [here](https://github.com/phylo42/IPK) for detail). Queries should be in non-compressed fasta format. An example of placement command (see below for possible parameters values):
```
epik.py place -i DATABASE -s [nucl|amino] -o OUTPUT_DIR INPUT_FASTA
```
If EPIK is not installed, run `./epik.py` from the EPIK directory instead. 

### Parameters

| Option    | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                 | Default |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| -i        | The path to the phylo-k-mer database to use for placement.                                                                                                              |         |
| -s        | States, `nucl` for DNA and `amino` for proteins                                                                                                                         | nucl    |
| --omega   | The user-defined threshold. Can be set higher than the one used when database was created. (If you are not sure, ignore this parameter.)                                | 1.5     |
| --mu      | The proportion of the database to keep when filtering. Mutually exclusive with `--max-ram`. Should be a value in (0.0, 1.0]                                             | 1.0     |
| --max-ram | The maximum amount of memory used to keep the database content. Mutually exclusive with `--mu`. Sets an approximate limit to EPIK's RAM consumption.                    |         |
| --threads | Number of parallel threads used for placement. EPIK should be compiled with OpenMP support enabled, i.e. `EPIK_OMP=ON`. (If you compile as we recommend, it is enabled) | 1       |

Also, see `epik.py place --help` for information.
